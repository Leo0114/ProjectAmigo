        On January 10, 2018, the U.S. State Department amended its <a
          href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/mexico-travel-advisory.html"
          target="_blank"
          class="text-sky-600 underline text-justify">travel warning</a
        >
         for the entire country of Mexico including the State of Colima where
        Project Amigo is located. The Statement with respect to Colima is a
        level 4 and advises US government employees to not travel in a large
        part of the state, and recommends no tourism to the area.

          For reference purposes, this is a map of the State of Colima. Project
          Amigo is in the mountains in the far northeast part of the State above
          Comala in the rural community of Cofradia de Suchitlan. Most of the
          staff is Mexican, and they have lived in Colima their whole lives. Our
          General Manager, Kirk Dretzka, is an American who grew up and lives in
          Tecoman, which is included in the travel warning. Project Amigo, in
          its 30+ years, has had no instance of violence or threatened violence.
          Further, we believe that Colima is safe, with the adequate precautions
          we always deem necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The violence in Colima is a result of the drug cartels and is centered
          in and along the coast and the boarder with Michoacan. This is at
          least a two-hour drive from our headquarters and primary base of
          operation. Cofradia de Suchitlan, Comala, Suchitlan and the
          surrounding areas have experienced no violence, gang or otherwise
        </p>

      <p>
        We take great care to ensure that visitors are not ever taken to places
        that might be risky. We routinely host visitors in Work Weeks, and our
        staff knows the areas of Colima that are safe and those that are prone
        to violence well. They understand the local issues and have their ears
        to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that our staff and our visitors to Mexico are safe. We will
        continue to take every precaution to ensure that safety. The State
        Department does not prohibit U.S. citizens from traveling to Mexico, but
        develops advisories based on what they tell their own workers about
        travel risks. Many of the conditions that are noted by the State
        Department have existed for years and have not escalated, <span
          class="underline font-extrabold"
          >but their advisory system has recently changed.</span

      <p>
        Our work in Mexico is important, and the people we serve there need our
        help. Project Amigo, with your assistance, has made a huge difference in
        the lives of families and we look forward to a long future of continuing
        to do so. We welcome any questions. Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact our
        staff or any member of our Board of Directors about this matter
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Bev Oster Ornelas, Board Chair</p>
